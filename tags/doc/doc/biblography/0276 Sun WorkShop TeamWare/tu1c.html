<p>Here are suggestions from other Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare tools users. Check with the administrator of your site for guidelines specific to your site.


<ul><p><li>Do bringovers often. Changes may occur in the parent workspace that affect your work.</li>

<p><li>Click the Entire Workspace button to bring over or put back all files in a workspace, or click the Add button to select specific files.</li>

<p><li>To select only a few files from a long list, click Select All, then click the files you want to keep to deselect them, then click Delete. Only the files you clicked remain.</li>

<p><li>If you are using Sun WorkShop TeamWare configuration management tools with the Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> development environment for source code, execute a build in the Building window after a bringover. This will propagate your changes throughout your application.</li>

<p><li>Split large workspaces into smaller workspaces. Divide a workspace into reasonable subgroups, and create workspaces from those.</li>

<p><li>Subdivide workspace directories for better performance. If you have over 2,000 files in a single directory, you could experience long delays when executing bringovers and putbacks. </li>

<p><li>Remember that when you create a freezepoint, only the differences between the current files and the original hierarchy is recorded. You must have the original workspace (or its parent or child) to extract from a freezepoint file.</li>

<p><li>Keep your <kbd>.cshrc </kbd>file small if you plan to use the distributed make feature. Each time dmake accesses a new machine, it reads <kbd>.cshrc</kbd>, so a large <kbd>.cshrc</kbd> file slows the process.</li>

<p><li>Avoid using the sccs subcommands <kbd>cdc</kbd>, <kbd>comb</kbd>, <kbd>fix</kbd>, and <kbd>rmdel</kbd> in TeamWare workspaces. Using these commands can alter SCCS history files in ways which will make them impossible for TeamWare to track.  These commands also have undesirable side effects when used on files that exist in multiple workspaces that eventually may be merged.<Table Border="0" Cellpadding="5">
<tr><td VALIGN=TOP><kbd>cdc</kbd>

<td VALIGN=TOP>Can cause unnecessary branching and confusing histories.


<tr><td VALIGN=TOP><kbd>comb</kbd>

<td VALIGN=TOP>Completely rebuilds the SCCS history file. 


<tr><td VALIGN=TOP><kbd>fix</kbd>

<td VALIGN=TOP>A front-end for <kbd>rmdel</kbd>.


<tr><td VALIGN=TOP><kbd>rmdel</kbd>

<td VALIGN=TOP>SCCS restricts the use of the <kbd>rmdel</kbd> command to remove only the most recent (leaf) delta on a branch.  If you remove a delta that also exists in another workspace, it is possible that another user will add a delta in the other workspace.  The delta that was removed in your workspace will no longer be a leaf delta when the files are merged.
