<a name="74">
<p><dl><dd>A feature in Configuring you can use to control access to workspaces. See <a href="ts3a.fm.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Start/ts3a.fm.html">Understanding Access Control</a>.</dl>

<p><dt><b>Branch (SCCS)</b>
</a>
<a name="76">
<p><dl><dd>A delta or series of deltas that are placed off of the main line of deltas in an SCCS history file. See  <a href="ti10a.fm.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Get/ti10a.fm.html">Branches, Deltas and Versions</a>.</dl>

<p><dt><b>Bringover Create</b>
</a>
<a name="78">
<p><dl><dd>The transaction used to copy groups of files from a parent workspace to a nonexistent child workspace. The new child workspace is created as a result of the transaction. All Configuring transfer transactions are performed from the perspective of the child workspace; hence the Bringover Create transaction &#34;brings over&#34; files to the child from the parent workspace. See also <I>Bringover Update, Workspace</I> and <I>Putback</I>.</dl>
</a>
<a name="65">
<p><dt><b>Bringover Update</b>
</a>
<a name="123">
<p><dl><dd>The transaction used to update an existing child workspace with respect to files contained in its parent workspace. All Configuring transfer transactions are performed from the perspective of the child workspace; the Bringover Update transaction &#34;brings over&#34; files to the child from the parent workspace. See also <I>Bringover Create, Workspace</I>, and <I>Putback</I>.</dl>
</a>
<a name="79">
<p><dt><b>Child workspace</b>
</a>
<a name="80">
<p><dl><dd>A workspace that has a parent workspace listed in its <kbd>Codemgr_wsdata/parents</kbd> file. Development work is typically done in child workspaces and put back to parent workspaces after it has been tested. The Configuring transfer transactions are viewed from the child workspace perspective, and all conflicts are resolved in the child workspace. See <a href="ts1c4.fm.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Start/ts1c4.fm.html">Creating a Child Workspace</a>.</dl>
</a>
<a name="134">
<p><dt><b><kbd>Codemgr_wsdata</kbd> directory</b>
</a>
<a name="3817">
<p><dl><dd>Every TeamWare workspace contains a &#34;metadata&#34; directory in its root directory named <kbd>Codemgr_wsdata</kbd>. Configuring stores data about the workspace in <kbd>Codemgr_wsdata</kbd>. The presence of this directory is the sole factor that defines it as a TeamWare workspace (as opposed to a normal directory). Configuring commands use the presence or absence of this directory to determine whether a directory is a workspace. See Chapter 12 of the <I>Sun WorkShop TeamWare User&#39;s Guide</I> for more information.</dl>

<a name="3821">
<p><dt><b>Configuring</b>
</a>

</a>
<a name="81">
<p><dt><b>Conflict</b>
</a>
<a name="82">
<p><dl><dd>The condition that exists when a file has changed in both the child and parent workspace.  Conflicts are identified by the Bringover Update transaction and are resolved by using the Resolve transaction.</dl>
</a>
<a name="83">
<p><dt><b>Copy-Modify-Merge</b>
</a>
<a name="84">
<p><dl><dd>The concurrent development model upon which Configuring is based. Using this model, multiple developers concurrently <I>copy</I> sources from a common area, <I>modify</I> the source in isolation, and then <I>merge</I> those changes with changes made by other developers.</dl>
</a>
<a name="85">
<p><dt><b>Create</b>
</a>
<a name="137">
<p><dl><dd>Used in Configuring transaction output. Files are said to be created if they exist in the source workspace and not in the destination workspace, and are copied into the destination workspace as part of a Bringover or Putback transaction.</dl>
</a>
<a name="136">
<p><dt><b>Default path</b>
</a>
<a name="86">
<p><dl><dd>The branch in an SCCS history file upon which the next delta will be added. This is indicated in a history file by a solid line.  See <a href="ti3a.fm.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Get/ti3a.fm.html">Viewing File History</a>.</dl>

</a>
<a name="3220">
<p><dt><b>Delta</b>
</a>
<a name="3227">
<p><dl><dd>The set of differences between two versions of a file checked into SCCS.When you check in a file, SCCS records only the line-by-line differences between the text you check in and the previous version of the file. This set of differences is known as a delta. The file version that you initially checked out was constructed from a set of accumulated deltas. The terms delta and version are often used synonymously; however, their meanings are not the same. It is possible to retrieve a version that omits selected deltas. See <a href="ti10a.fm.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Get/ti10a.fm.html">Branches, Deltas and Versions</a>.</dl>

<p><dt><b>History files</b>
</a>
<a name="852">
<p><dl><dd>When you initially put a file under SCCS control, a history file is created for the new SCCS file. The initial version of the history file uses the complete text of the source file. The initial history file is the file that further deltas are compared to. Owing to its prefix (s.), the history file is often referred to as the s.file (s-dot-file).

<p><dl><dd>To assure consistency, the Configuring file transfer transactions Bringover and Putback lock workspaces while they are working in them.

<a name="129">
<p><dl><dd>The transaction used to update a parent workspace with respect to files contained in its child workspace.
