<p>
<i>
If you have tried version control, but are frustrated by the
need to set explicit locks every time you want to edit a file, or
perhaps dislike being unable to edit a file when other developers
have already locked a file, CVS is for you.
</i>
</p><p>
<i>by Tom Morse</i>
</p><p>
CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a version control system. With CVS,
developers are able to review the change history of any source file,
retrieve any revision of a particular file, avoid overwriting one
another's changes, and keep track of releases and the file revisions that
go along with them.
</p><p>
First, a short introduction to some of the concepts of CVS. All the
sources for a project are stored in a central location called the
repository. The sources in the repository are organized into
modules. Typically each module represents a separate project. A module
can represent any number of files and directories.
</p><p>
When a developer wishes to work with a particular set of
sources he uses CVS to retrieve a local copy of them. This local copy can
represent the most recent revision of each file or some past
revision.
</p><p>
Typical version control systems require a user to ``lock'' each file he
wishes to edit, preventing other developers from editing these files
until the first user has committed his changes. This can be quite time
consuming as developers either wait for one another to commit changes, or
work simultaneously and manually merge the changes together later on. CVS
solves this problem by allowing concurrent editing.
</p><p>
Concurrent editing allows two or more developers to work concurrently
on the same files. Ordinarily, concurrent editing leads to one developer
overwriting another's previously committed changes.
</p><p>
CVS prevents overwrites by forcing a developer to merge into his local
copy any changes that have been committed to a file in the repository
since he retrieved his local copy of that file. Only then can the
developer commit his changes. The process is mostly automatic, but if, 
for instance, changes have been made to the same
line of code in both the repository and the local copy, manual resolution
of the conflict is necessary. 
</p><p>
</p><h3>A day in the Life of...,</h3>
<p>
Let's look in on our software development team in action. Due
to the confidentiality of their project, all the file names
have been changed to protect the innocent. Their project is to
``build a better mouse trap.''
</p><p>
</p><h3>Fixing Bugs</h3>
<p>
Fezzik, though primarily a documentation writer, 
<i>(This explains why all our team's manuals are in 
rhyme.)</i>
does some detecting
and squashing of software bugs in the course of his work.
Let's watch as Fezzik
fixes a critical bug in a previous release of the product.
</p><p>
Version 4.0 of the product was released a few months ago. Now a
critical bug has been found by a very important customer. The bug must
be fixed in the released version of the software, a point release made
for the customer, and the fix must be merged into the working version of
the software.
</p><p>
In investigating the problem, Fezzik has determined that the bug was
introduced between the 3.3 and 4.0 versions of the software. His
first step is to get a copy of the 4.0 sources. He does this with the
command:
</p><p>
</p><pre>cvs checkout -r PROD_REL4-0 mousetrap</pre>
<p>
This will check out all of the directories and source code files for
the entire project. The version of each source file will be the version
that was included in the release with the name PROD_REL4-0, exclusive of
any changes that have been to that source file since the release.
</p><p>
Now Fezzik has a new directory called mousetrap. In this directory are
all the project sources as they were when the release 4.0 was made.
Because development on the project has continued since release 4.0, Fezzik
must start a new branch on the revision tree from this point. He uses the
following commands:
</p><p>
</p><pre>cvs tag -b POINT_RELS_REL4-0 
cvs update -r POINT_RELS_REL4-0
</pre>
<p>
The revision tree will look like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre> 
                    |HEAD - dev for next full release 
POINT_RELS_REL4-0\  | 
                  \ | 
                   \| 
                    +PROD_REL4-0 
                    | 
                    | 
                    | 
                    +PROD_REL3-3 
                    | 
                    | 

</pre>
<p>
Fezzik could have created the branch tag before checking out the
project, eliminating one step from the method he used. The following
sequence would produce the same effect as above:
</p><p>
</p><pre>cvs rtag -b -r PROD_REL4-0 POINT_RELS_REL4-0 mousetrap 
cvs checkout -r POINT_RELS_REL4-0
</pre>
<p>
CVS has many command and option combinations. Therefore, there is often
more than one way to produce the same or similar results. This
flexibility allows CVS to be adapted to a wide range of development
processes.
</p><p>
Fezzik suspects that the file cheese.c contains the bug, so he decides
to view all the changes made to that file between releases 3.3 and
4.0. To do this he uses the diff command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs diff -r PROD_REL3-3 cheese.c</tt>
</p><p>
This produces a listing of the differences between the file cheese.c in
our current directory and the revision used in PROD_REL3-3. Fezzik
could have specified a second revision with a 
</p><p>
<tt>-r PROD_REL4-0</tt> 

</p><p>
and had the same effect.
</p><p>
In reviewing the differences, Fezzik finds what he believes to be the
bug he is looking for. He would like to clear any modifications he plans with the person
who made the change, so he looks at the log file for cheese.c.
</p><p>
<tt>cvs log cheese.c</tt>
</p><p>
He sees that only Buttercup modified this file between the two releases,
so he is able to talk to her about the fix. After making the fix and
testing it, Fezzik is ready to commit his changes. He issues the
following command from the top directory of the project:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs commit -m ``Fixed bug #1202''</tt>

</p><p>
Fezzik did not specify a specific file to commit, so this command will
commit all modified files in this directory and, recursively, in all of
its subdirectories. Each file committed will have the message
``Fixed bug #1202'' added as a log message. Since this fix will be sent to
a customer, Fezzik decides to tag the set of files that will be sent:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs tag PROD_REL4-0-1</tt>

</p><p>
Now Fezzik needs to create the patch file to be sent to the customer:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs rdiff -r PROD_REL4-0 -r PROD_REL4-0-1 mousetrap &gt; patch4.0-4.0.1
</tt>
</p><p>
This creates a Larry Wall format patch file which the customer can feed
into the patch program to update his sources. The patches will update
the customer's 4.0 sources to the new 4.0.1 sources.
</p><p>
Now Fezzik needs to merge the fix into the current development
sources. First he updates his sources to the latest revisions on the
main thread by using this command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs update -A
</tt>
</p><p>
This has the same effect as deleting the local copy of the module, and
doing a new checkout of the module, thereby getting the latest
revisions.

</p><p>
Then he has CVS automatically merge in the changes from the 4.0.1 point
release with:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs update -j PROD_REL4-0-1
</tt>
</p><p>
CVS will automatically merge the changes Fezzik made on the branch
into these latest sources. If the merging of the two sets of sources
causes conflicts, CVS will announce this.  At the conflict
points in the file, there will be delimited regions containing the text
from both sources. These regions will need to be merged manually.
</p><p>
Once everything is merged, Fezzik can commit all of the changes using
another commit command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs commit -m ``Merged in fixes in PROD_REL4-0-1''
</tt>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Contention</h3>
<p>
Now we turn to Westley, who will demonstrate how CVS is used when
working on a multiple-person project.
</p><p>
Westley has been off the project for a month 
<i>[ not too
surprising, what with his having been dead and all]</i>. The first
thing he needs to do is bring his sources up to date.
</p><p>
<tt>cvs update
</tt>
</p><p>
Since he has not modified anything since his last commit everything
simply updates; no conflicts could exist. Now Westley would like to see
what has happened since his departure on April 10. He uses the
following command to view all the log messages for the commits that were
made after April 10th:
</p><p>        
<tt>cvs log -d&gt;4/10 -b
</tt>
</p><p>
After reviewing the log file he feels caught up, so he jumps right into
modifying sources. During the course of his work he needs to create a
new file, happiness.c. After he creates the file happiness.c on the disk, he
issues the following command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs add happiness.c
</tt>
</p><p>
Westley also obsoletes a file, and after deleting the file, he issues
the following command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs delete agony.c
</tt>
</p><p>
Both the add and delete commands will not take full effect until the
CVS commit is done.
</p><p>
After a day of work, Westley has added a new feature and is ready to
commit his modifications. He issues the following command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs commit -m ``Made a number of wonderful improvements''
</tt>
</p><p>
CVS informs him that someone else has already committed changes to some
of the files that he has made changes to, so he must update his files
with the other developer's changes before committing his own. A simple
call to the update command will do this:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs update
</tt>
</p><p>
After manually editing to resolve any conflicts between his changes
and the changes already made to the repository, Westley tests his new
feature again. Everything looks okay, so he attempts his commit again:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs commit -m ``Made a number of wonderful improvements''
</tt>
</p><p>
This time it works. This method of working is quite an improvement over
many systems where a person must first lock a file before it can be
edited, and anyone else wanting to edit the file must wait until the
first person has committed changes and unlocked the file.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Releases</h3>
<p>
Now Buttercup will demonstrate how to release a new version of the
software. She begins by checking out the latest sources.
</p><p>
<tt>cvs checkout mousetrap
</tt>
</p><p>
After verifying that these sources are the exact versions that should
be released, she tags the release:
</p><p>        
<tt>cvs tag PROD_REL4-1
</tt>
</p><p>
Then she creates a set of directories containing all of the sources to
be delivered by using the export command:
</p><p>
<tt>cvs export -R PROD_REL4-1 mousetrap
</tt>
</p><p>
This will create a directory structure filled with only the correct
sources and none of the CVS administration directories or files.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The full power of CVS exceeds the scope of this article, but 
I hope I have provided enough of a taste to entice you to try CVS. We have been
using it for 5 months at Lernout &amp; Hauspie, and are more than pleased
with its performance.
