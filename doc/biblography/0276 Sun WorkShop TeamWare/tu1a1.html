<p>The Configuring window is the main window for Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare tools. You create and manipulate workspaces and the relationships between workspaces in the Configuring window.


<p>Once you load a workspace by choosing File <img src="rightwingarrow.gif" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Under/rightwingarrow.gif">  Load Workspaces, you select the workspace to make it the focus of Configuring commands. You can drag the workspace to an empty space in the Configuring window to initiate a Bringover Create transaction. You can also drag the icon of a child workspace to the parent icon to initiate a Putback transaction.


<p>When you perform a Putback, Configuring determines if differences exist between the files in the originating workspace and the destination workspace. Under normal circumstances, Configuring simply propagates the changes from the child workspace to the parent workspace. However, if changes already exist in the parent workspace (for example, if another team member has already put back changes), Configuring prevents you from propagating your changes. Instead, you can bring over the conflicting file and resolve the conflicts in your workspace using Merging. Once the conflicts are resolved, you are allowed to peform a putback.


<p>You can select multiple workspaces by pressing the Shift key and clicking on workspaces. Clicking the right mouse button displays the commands from the Workspace menu.


<p>From the Configuring window, you can launch the other Sun WorkShop TeamWare tools:
