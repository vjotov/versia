<p>When you begin to use the Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare code management tools, you can start a new project or import existing project files into Sun WorkShop TeamWare (see <a href="ts1c.fm.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Start/ts1c.fm.html">Creating New Workspaces</a>). 


<p>Sun WorkShop TeamWare tools organize files into <I>workspaces</I>. A workspace is a specially designated directory, its subdirectories and the files contained in those directories. Using Sun WorkShop TeamWare tools, you manage the files in the workspace and the relationships with other workspaces.


<p>Start a project by creating a top-level, or <I>parent</I>, workspace. You create a <I>child</I> workspace from this parent workspace by doing a special copy of the files called a <I>bringover</I>. Team members make changes in their own child workspaces, and later integrate their files with changes made by other team members. When users integrate changes, it is called a <I>putback</I>. 


<p>When you create a workspace, SunWorkShop TeamWare creates a subdirectory, named <kbd>Codemgr_wsdata</kbd>, that stores information about the files in the workspace.
