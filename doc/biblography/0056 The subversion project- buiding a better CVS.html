<!-- START -->
If you work on any kind of open-source
project, you've probably worked with CVS. You probably remember
the first time you learned to do an anonymous checkout of a source tree
over the Net, your first commit or learning how to look at CVS diffs.
And then the fateful day came: you asked your friend how to rename a
file. ``You can't'', was the reply.
</p><p>
``What? What do you mean?'' you asked.
</p><p>
``Well, you can delete the file from the repository and then re-add
it under a new name.''
</p><p>
``Yes, but then nobody would know it had been renamed.''
</p><p>
``Let's call the CVS administrator. She can hand-edit the
repository's RCS files for us and possibly make things work.''
</p><p>
``What?''
</p><p>
``And by the way, don't try to delete a directory
either.''
</p><p>
You rolled your eyes and groaned. How could such simple tasks be so
difficult?
</p><p>
</p><h3>The Legacy of CVS</h3>
<p>
No doubt about it, CVS has evolved into the standard software
configuration management (SCM) system of the Open Source community,
and rightly so. CVS is free software and has a wonderful nonlocking
development model that allows hundreds of far-flung programmers to
collaborate. In fact, one might argue that, without CVS, it's
doubtful whether sites like Freshmeat or SourceForge ever would have
flourished as they do now. CVS and its semi-chaotic development model
have become an essential part of Open Source culture.
</p><p>
So what's wrong with CVS? Because it uses the RCS storage system
under the hood, CVS can only track file contents, not tree structures. As
a result, the user has no way to copy, move or rename items without
losing history. Tree rearrangements are always ugly server-side tweaks.
</p><p>
The RCS back end cannot store binary files efficiently, and branching
and tagging operations can become very slow. CVS also uses the network
inefficiently; many users are annoyed by long waits, because file
differences are sent in only one direction (from server to client, but
not from client to server), and binary files are always transmitted in
their entirety.
</p><p>
From a developer's standpoint, the CVS codebase is the result of
layers upon layers of historical ``hacks''. (Remember that
CVS began life as a collection of shell scripts to drive RCS.) This
makes the code difficult to understand, maintain or extend. For example,
CVS's networking ability was essentially stapled on. It was never
designed to be a native client/server system.
</p><p>
Rectifying CVS's problems is a huge task, and we've only
listed a few of the many common complaints here.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Enter Subversion</h3>
<p>
In 1995, Karl Fogel and Jim Blandy founded Cyclic
Software, a company for commercially supporting and improving
CVS. Cyclic made the first public release of a network-enabled CVS
(contributed by Cygnus software). In 1999, Karl Fogel published
a book about CVS and the open-source development model it enables
(<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/" target="_blank">cvsbook.red-bean.com</a>). Karl and Jim had long talked about
writing a replacement for CVS; Jim even had drafted a new, theoretical
repository design. Finally, in February 2000, Brian Behlendorf of
Collabnet (<a href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_blank">www.collab.net</a>) offered Karl a full-time job to
write a CVS replacement. Karl gathered a team and work began in May.
</p><p>
The team settled on a few simple goals: it was decided that Subversion
would be designed as a functional replacement for CVS. It would do
everything that CVS does, preserving the same development model while
fixing the flaws in CVS's (lack of) design. Existing CVS users
would be the target audience; any CVS user should be able to start using
Subversion with little effort. Any other bonus features were decided to
be of secondary importance (at least before a 1.0 release).
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, the original team has been coding for
a little over a year, and we have a number of excellent volunteer
contributors. (Subversion, like CVS, is an open-source project.)
</p><p>
</p><h3>Subversion's Features</h3>
<p>
Here's a quick rundown of some of the reasons you should be
excited about Subversion:
</p><p>
</p><li>	Real copies and renames: the Subversion repository
doesn't use RCS files at all; instead, it implements a virtual
versioned filesystem that tracks tree structures over time (described
below). Files <i>and</i> directories are versioned. At last there are real
client-side mv and cp commands that behave just as you think.
<p>
</p></li><li>	Atomic commits: a commit either goes into the
repository completely or not all.
<p>
</p></li><li>	Advanced network layer: the Subversion network
server is Apache, and client and server speak WebDAV(2) to each other.
(See the ``Subversion Design'' section below.)
<p>
</p></li><li>	Faster network access: a binary diffing algorithm is
used to store and transmit deltas in <i>both</i> directions, regardless
of whether a file is of text or binary type.
<p>
</p></li><li>	Filesystem properties: each file or directory
has an invisible hash table attached. You can invent and store any
arbitrary key/value pairs you wish: owner, perms, icons, app-owner,
MIME type, personal notes, etc. This is a general-purpose feature for
users. Properties are versioned, just like file contents. And some
properties are auto-detected, like the MIME type of a file (no more
remembering to use the -kb switch).
<p>
</p></li><li>	Extensible and hackable: Subversion has no
historical baggage; it was designed and implemented as a collection
of shared C libraries with well defined APIs. This makes Subversion
extremely maintainable and usable by other applications and languages.
<p>
</p></li><li>	Easy migration: the Subversion command-line
client is very similar to CVS; the development model is the same, so
CVS users should have little trouble making the switch. Development of
a cvs2svn repository converter is in progress.
<p>
</p></li><li>	It's free: Subversion is released under
an Apache/BSD-style, open-source license.
<p>
</p><h3>Subversion's Design</h3>
<p>
Subversion has a modular design; it's implemented as a
collection of C libraries. Each layer has a well defined purpose and
interface. In general, code flow begins at the top of the diagram and
flows downward--each layer provides an interface to the layer
above it (see Figure 1). Let's take a short tour of these layers,
starting at the bottom.
</p><p>
<a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/520000/513042/4768f1.png"><h4>Figure 1. Design Layers of Subversion</h4></a>
</p><h3>The Subversion Filesystem</h3>
<p>
The Subversion Filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem that
one would install in an operating system (like the Linux ext2 fs).
Instead, it refers to the design of Subversion's repository. The
repository is built on top of a database, currently Berkeley DB, and
thus is a collection of .db files. However, a library accesses these
files and exports a C API that simulates a filesystem, specifically a
versioned filesystem.
</p><p>
This means that writing a program to access the repository
is like writing against other filesystem APIs: you can open files and
directories for reading and writing as usual. The main difference is that this
particular filesystem never loses data when written to; old versions of
files and directories always are saved as historical artifacts.
</p><p>
Whereas CVS's back end (RCS) stores revision numbers on a per-file
basis, Subversion numbers entire trees. Each atomic commit to the
repository creates a completely new filesystem tree and is individually
labeled with a single, global revision number. Files and directories that
have changed are rewritten (and older versions are backed up and stored
as differences against the latest version), while unchanged entries are
pointed to via a shared-storage mechanism. This is how the repository
is able to version tree structures, not just file contents.
</p><p>
Finally, it should be mentioned that using a database like Berkeley
DB immediately provides other nice features that Subversion needs:
data integrity, atomic writes, recoverability and hot backups. See
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/" target="_blank">www.sleepycat.com</a> for more information.
</p><p>
</p><h3>The Network Layer</h3>
<p>
Subversion has the mark of Apache all over it. At its very core,
the client uses the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. In fact,
this means that a Subversion client should compile and run anywhere
Apache httpd does. Right now, this list includes all flavors of UNIX,
Win32, BeOS, OS/2, Mac OS X and possibly NetWare.
</p><p>
However, Subversion depends on more than just APR; the Subversion
server is Apache httpd itself. Why was Apache chosen? Ultimately,
the decision was about not re-inventing the wheel. Apache is a
time-tested, open-source server process ready for serious use, yet
is still extensible. It can sustain a high-network load. It runs on
many platforms and can operate through firewalls. It's able to
use a number of different authentication protocols. It can do network
pipelining and caching. By using Apache as a server, Subversion gets
all these features for free. Why start from scratch?
</p><p>
Subversion uses WebDAV as its network protocol. DAV (distributed
authoring and versioning) is a whole discussion in itself
(<a href="http://www.webdav.org/" target="_blank">www.webdav.org</a>), but in short, it's an extension to
HTTP that allows reads/writes and versioning of files over the Web. The
Subversion Project is hoping to ride a slowly rising tide of support
for this protocol; all of the latest file browsers for Win32, Mac OS and
GNOME speak this protocol already. Interoperability will (hopefully)
become more and more of a bonus over time.
</p><p>
For users who simply wish to access Subversion repositories on local
disk, the client can do this too; no network is required. The Repository
Access (RA) layer is an abstract API implemented by both the DAV and
local-access RA libraries. This is a specific benefit of writing a
``librarized'' revision control system; it's a big win
over CVS, which has two very different, difficult-to-maintain code paths
for local vs. network repository-access. Feel like writing a new network
protocol for Subversion? Just write a new library that implements the
RA API.
</p><p>
</p><h3>The Client Libraries</h3>
<p>
On the client side, the Subversion working copy library maintains
administrative information within special /SVN subdirectories, similar
in purpose to the /CVS administrative directories found in CVS working
copies.
</p><p>
A glance inside the typical /SVN directory turns up a bit more
than usual, however. The entries file contains XML that describes the
current state of the working copy directory (and that basically serves
the purposes of CVS's Entries, Root and Repository files combined).
But, other items present (and not found in /CVS) include storage locations
for the versioned properties (the metadata mentioned in the ``Subversion
Features'' section above) and private caches of pristine versions of
each file. This latter feature provides the ability to report local
modifications and do reversions without network access. Authentication
data also is stored within /SVN, rather than in a single .cvspass-like
file.
</p><p>
The Subversion client library has the broadest responsibility. Its job
is to mingle the functionality of the working-copy library with that of
the repository-access library, and then to provide a highest-level API to
any application that wishes to perform general revision control actions.
</p><p>
For example, the C routine svn_client_checkout() takes a URL as an
argument. It passes this URL to the repository-access library and opens
an authenticated session with a particular repository. It then asks the
repository for a certain tree and sends this tree into the working-copy
library, which then writes a full working copy to disk (/SVN directories
and all).
</p><p>
The client library is designed to be used by any application. While
the Subversion source code includes a standard command-line client, it
should be easy to write any number of GUI clients on top of the client
library. Hopefully, these GUIs should someday prove to be much better
than the current crop of CVS GUI applications, which are no more than
fragile wrappers around the CVS command-line client.
</p><p>
In addition, proper SWIG bindings (<a href="http://www.swig.org/" target="_blank">www.swig.org</a>) should
make the Subversion API available for any number of languages: Java,
Perl, Python, Guile and so on. In order to Subvert CVS, it helps to
be ubiquitous.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Subversion's Future</h3>
<p>
The release of Subversion 1.0 currently is planned for the beginning
of 2002. After the release of 1.0, Subversion is slated for additions
such as i18n support, intelligent merging, better changeset manipulation,
client-side plugins and improved features for server administration. Also
on the wish list is an eclectic collection of ideas such as distributed,
replicating repositories.
</p><p>
A final thought from Subversion's FAQ: ``We aren't
(yet) attempting to break new ground in SCM systems, nor are we
attempting to imitate all the best features of every SCM system out
there. We're trying to replace CVS.''
</p><p>
If in three years Subversion is widely presumed to be the standard
SCM system in the Open Source community, then the project will have
succeeded. But the future is still hazy. Ultimately, Subversion will
have to win this position on its own technical merits. Patches are
welcome.
