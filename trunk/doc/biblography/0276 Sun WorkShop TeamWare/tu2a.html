<p>Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare is a source management product designed for use by a team of people who develop software concurrently. With Sun WorkShop TeamWare, you can: 


<ul><p><li>Configure your working directories and subdirectories (or folders) into workspaces to suit the phases of your project and the structure of your team.</li>

<p><li>Work on individual versions of the same file, but also ensure that everyone has the latest version in their own individual workspaces. </li>

<p><li>Inside a single workspace, lock a file for editing to prevent unmanaged conflicts.</li>

<p><li>Inspect and selectively merge versions of a single file that was edited in different workspaces.</li>

<p><li>Find and "freeze" a particular version of a directory, archiving it for later use.</li>

<p><li>Build an application for release from selected files and directories--either locally (serially or in parallel) or across a distributed system.</li>

<p><li>Automatically notify team members of each action that has been taken on a file. </li>

</ul><p>Sun WorkShop TeamWare's version-control capability is based on an underlying program called SCCS (Source Code Control System). The workspaces you configure with Sun WorkShop TeamWare act only upon files that have been placed under SCCS control.
