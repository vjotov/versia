<dl>
<dd>As the members of your development team work on files and directories, and as the team moves through the process of developing an application, they do the following things on a regular, iterative basis. 

</dl>
<dl>
<p><dt><dd><strong>	1.	</strong> Team members bring over directories from the Development parent workspace to their own child workspaces. 
<dl><a name="107074">
<p><dd>It&#39;s important that each team member do bringovers frequently.  This practice keeps the team's changes freshly propagated throughout their workspaces, a necessity if everyone is to stay up to date.
<p></a><a name="107070">
<p><dd>Team members make their changes in their individual child workspaces, and then put back the changed directories to the Development parent workspace.
<p></a><a name="107071">
<p><dd>TeamWare automatically notifies the whole team (or whoever has been specified to the tool during the configuring step) when changes have been put back. 
<p></a></dl></dl>
<dl>
<p><dt><dd><strong>	2.	</strong> Team leaders check the changes that team members have put back. Team leaders then put back those changed directories from the Development parent workspace to the Integration workspace. 
<p><dt><dd><strong>	3.	</strong> When notified that the files in the Integration workspace are ready, the buildmaster integrates all the files, builds the application, and puts back the resulting directories to the Nightly_Build workspace.  
<p><dt><dd><strong>	4.	</strong> When notified that Nightly_Build workspace is ready, the software testers go to that workspace and test the application.  
<p><dt><dd><strong>	5.	</strong> Periodically, two or three team members find that they have been working on their own copies of the same file, and they use TeamWare to selectively merge their changes. 
<p><dt><dd><strong>	6.	</strong> Periodically, a team member sets aside or archives a particular &#34;snapshot&#34; of a directory (a freezepoint) for later use.
<dl><a name="107079">
<p><dd>Because TeamWare keeps track of all versions of each directory, you can search for the past version you want to freeze.  The full directory can then be extracted from the freezepoint you create, with all its contents reflecting that point in time.
