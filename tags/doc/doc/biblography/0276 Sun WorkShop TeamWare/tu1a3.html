<p>During the software development process it is often useful to preserve the exact state of the files in a project at certain point in time. Freezepoints are snapshots of a project that enable you to later re-create the state of the project.


<p>One way to preserve the state of the project is to make a copy of the project files using standard backup utilities. This method is effective, but it requires a large amount of time and storage resources. With Freezepointing, you preserve freezepoints quickly and simply, using a small amount of storage resource, because freezepoints are only a list of differences between the original file(s) and the current version of the file(s). (See <a href="tf2a1.html" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Freeze/tf2a1.html" Target=Topic>Creating a Freezepoint</a>)


<p>You can re-create the state of the project by extracting from the freezepoint file.You can extract an entire workspace, a complete set of files, or a subset of the files.
