<h4><font size=4>Files That Won&#39;t Go Away
</font></h4><p>If you delete a file in a Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare child workspace using Operating System commands, the file will re-appear during the next bringover or putback. The best way to delete files is to use the Versioning delete command from the Workspace menu (Workspace <img src="rightwingarrow-1.gif" tppabs="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/tw-help/Get/rightwingarrow.gif">  Delete Files). When you delete a file in with Versioning, it moves the file into a <kbd>deleted_files</kbd> directory. This way, the deletion of the file is propagated throughout other workspaces, and the file does not reappear.


<h4><font size=4>Renaming Files
</font></h4><p>The file names in the parent workspace always dictate file names in the child workspaces. When a file is renamed in a parent workspace, Configuring propagates this name change throughout the child workspaces. For example, if file C is renamed D in the parent workspace, on the next bringover or putback Configuring recognizes file C in the child workspace and renames it to D.


<p>If a file is renamed to different names in both the parent and child workspaces, Configuring resolves the conflict by changing the name of the file in the child workspaces to the new name from the file in the parent workspace. For example, file C is renamed D in the parent workspace and at the same time C is renamed E in the child workspace, on the next bringover or putback, Configuring renames the file to D in the child workspace.
