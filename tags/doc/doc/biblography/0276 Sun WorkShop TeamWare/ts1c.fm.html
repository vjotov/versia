<p>Your team does its work in directories (or folders) and files. You place all your working directories in one high-level directory. Sun WorkShop TeamWare<sup>TM</sup> tools makes your high-level directory into an intelligent, powerful master workspace. When you copy that master workspace to create a new workspace Sun WorkShop TeamWare creates a special relationship between those workspaces: The central workspace becomes the <I>parent</I> of the <I>child</I> (copy) workspace. The child workspace is where you perform you work. You populate your child workspace by bringing over from the parent a copy of each directory containing files that you need to work on.


<p>A parent workspace may have any number of child workspaces. Also, one parent workspace may be the child of another parent workspace.
