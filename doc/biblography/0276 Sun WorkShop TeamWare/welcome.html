<p>When you work on a large project with many team members and many more files, it is hard to keep track of the files. Source code files change when you add new features, fix bugs and release new versions of the software. Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare configuration management tools help you manage projects by keeping track of files and preventing users from writing over each other&#39;s changes. With Sun WorkShop TeamWare, you have continuous access to all files in a project, and the tools to maintain the integrity of the files.
