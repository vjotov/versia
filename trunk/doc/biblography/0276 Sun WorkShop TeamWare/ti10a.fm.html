<p>The Sun WorkShop<sup>TM</sup> TeamWare versioning tool keeps track of the various versions of a file for the entire life of the file. Each time you check a file in, Versioning records the line-by-line differences between the file you check in and the previous version of the file. This line-by-line difference is known as <I>delta</I>. 


<p>When you check a file in to Sun WorkShop TeamWare for the first time, it is numbered 1.1 by default. Successive deltas are numbered 1.2, 1.3, and so forth. The straight progression from 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so forth, is know as the trunk of an SCCS tree.


<p>There are times, however, when it is necessary to create an alternative branches off of the trunk. <I>Branches</I> are used to allow you to develop two different versions of the same file in parallel, often for bug fixes in source code. Branches are numbered from where they split off from the tree, for example, 1.2.1.


<p>The terms delta and version are often used synonymously; however, their meanings are not the same. Versioning constructs a <I>version</I> of a file from a set of accumulated deltas. It is possible to retrieve a version of a file that omits certain deltas.
